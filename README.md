# Project 

This project is to analyse dependency graph generated by [sbt-dependency-graph]()

## Steps

To run `graphviz` we need to have a Python venv follwing [Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment). As follows is a step-by-step instruction.

### Install GraphViz on MacOS

```zsh
brew install graphviz
```

Otherwise, you will have `ExecutableNotFound: failed to execute PosixPath('dot'), make sure the Graphviz executables are on your systems' PATH` issue.

### Create virtual environments

1. Creation of [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def) is done by executing the command `venv`:

```zsh
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
### Activate a virtual environment

Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific python and pip executables into your shell’s PATH.

```zsh
source venv/bin/activate
```

As long as your virtual environment is activated pip will install packages into that specific environment and you’ll be able to import and use packages in your Python application.

### Leaving the virtual environment
If you want to switch projects or otherwise leave your virtual environment, simply run:

```zsh
deactivate
```

## Install required packages

After activating `venv`,

```zsh
python -m pip install graphviz jupyter jupyterlab --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --default-timeout=1000
```

Dump it as requirements.txt

```zsh
pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
